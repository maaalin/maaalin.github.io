POSTCARD CAMPAIGN

In GRAP2311 Creative Advertising at RMIT, one of the assignments was to develop a postcard campaign based on a brief from an earlier assignment (hence the differing specifications, see response to original brief HERE link). The campaign was to consist of three postcards with a front and back, and to be ready for print. I chose to work with the brief for Spirit of Tasmania.

One of the assignments in GRAP2311 Creative Advertising at RMIT was to, based on a number of quick briefs, develop advertising concepts for the briefed products. Below are four of my finished scamps and their rationales.
