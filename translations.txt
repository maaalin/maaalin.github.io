POSTCARD CAMPAIGN

In GRAP2311 Creative Advertising at RMIT, one of the assignments was to develop a postcard campaign based on a brief from an earlier assignment (hence the differing specifications, see response to original brief HERE link). The campaign was to consist of three postcards with a front and back, and to be ready for print. I chose to work with the brief for Spirit of Tasmania.

What: Assignment in GRAP2311 Creative Advertising during my semester at RMIT University
Client: Spirit of Tasmania
Target group: Retired and semi-retired holiday makers in Victoria and Tasmania
Objective: To develop a postcard campaign, more information in the included design brief
Challenges: Coming up with a creative campaign concept. Attacked this challenge by focusing on the service's main competition, and dramatized the proposition in order to draw attention.
See the included rationale to learn more about the design process for this project and what influenced it.

QUICK BRIEFS
One of the assignments in GRAP2311 Creative Advertising at RMIT was to, based on a number of quick briefs, develop advertising concepts for the briefed products. Below are four of my finished scamps and their rationales.

ESKILSTUNA STADSLOPP
What: Graphic identity for Swedish quarter marathon
Client: Eskilstuna Stadslopp
Target group: Runners of all ages
Objective: To develop a graphic identity that felt fresh, sporty, and would distinguish itself from competitors
Challenges: Including a bit of Eskilstuna in the logo and finding a visual expression that felt exciting and fun, yet serious

BRANDING
What: Graphic identities for fictional brands
Clients: Frames & Frames, a company selling glasses and picture frames; Creative Tub, a creative agency 
Target group: Young adults for Frames & Frames; SMEs for Creative Tub
Objective: To develop graphic identities for these brands
Challenges: Finding a unique expression for each brand. To avoid repeating
myself and getting out of my comfort zone, moodboards and online colour
palette tools have played a major roles in handling this challenge.

BMTH
What: Assignment in TNGD46 Document Production and Publishing at Linköping University
Team: Worked together with Sofia Krantz. Project didn't include any designated roles.
Client: Bring Me The Horizon (fictional case)
Target group: Fans of the band Bring Me The Horizon
Objective: To code a functional website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Challenges: Two main technical challenges: incorporating a hover effect on the discography page, and making it possible to change
the colour theme of the website and not have the change reset when the user navigates
to a different page. We managed to get both of these functions to work through a lot of research (shout-out to Stack Overflow) and
tons of trial and error.
See the finished website here.

TALK SHOW
What: Graphic identity for talk show produced as part of COMM2220 Live Media at RMIT University
Client: What's Poppin'? (satirical news show)
Target group: Young adults
Objective: Part of the assignment was to produce graphics for the talk show. For fun I took it upon myself to
not only do this, but to develop a graphic identity for the show
Challenges: Finding a visual expression that could be used in the logo, lower third graphics, over the shoulder graphics, and
full screen graphics. Attacked the challenge by keeping it simple and focusing on three bold colours, combined
with a versatile font. Also decided to just have fun with it, as What's Poppin'? is supposed to be a fun show

EDITORIAL DESIGN
What: Assignment in the course TNGD38 Editorial Design at Linköping University
Client: Travel magazine <em>På vift</em> (translates to <em>Out and About</em>)
Target group: People interested in budget-friendly travel
Objective: To design a magazine ready for print
Challenges: Making the magazine feel elegant but not expensive, and to figure
out different page layouts that differ from each but still feel cohesive.
Regarding the first challenge, I early on decided to keep the
magazine somewhat minimalistic, and eventually decided to add muted colours
to make it feel more available (as opposed to exclusive). Regarding the second challenge,
countless iterations and lots of inspo searching paved the way to the final result.


BITS AND PIECES
What: Collection of various works that didn't quite call for their own page
Client: Various
Target group: Also various
Objective: This and that
Challenges: So many

QUICK BRIEFS
What: Assignment for GRAP2311 Creative Advertising at RMIT University
Client: Chobani; Gorilla Glue; Spriggy; Spirit of Tasmania
Target group: Various, see rationales
Objective: To come up with creative ad concepts in response to "quick briefs"
Challenges: Brainstorming past the predictable ideas. Key to tackling this was lots of sketching,
in order to get a substantial amount of ideas to choose from. Also spent a lot of
time brainstorming how to dramatize the proposition, as well as paid
great attention to the feedback I got from my tutor.

What: Internship at communication agency Identx
Team: The people at Identx. My role was mainly as a graphic designer
Client: Various
Target group: Various
Objective: Everything from producing infographics to sketching logo ideas. As the internship was part of
the course TNGD35 at Linköping University, it included creating a poster about the internship.
Challenges: Adhering to the clients' wishes. Tried to be attentive and remade designs numerous times in order to 
do this. As for the poster, finding a functional yet fun way to organize the text was the biggest challenge. Changed
courses midway through when the first one didn't work as planned, see sketches and final poster lower down on this page.

What: Bachelor's thesis (design-oriented)
Target group: Sexually active young adults
Objective: To explore how visual communication may be used in order to encourage sexually active young adults to get tested for STD's
Challenges: One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to communicate about a sensitive and somewhat stigmatized topic in an appealing way. I based my design work off of a frame of reference that dived into sexual health and risk-taking, health communication, cultural aspects and behavioural design, and combined this with a preliminary study that sought to gain an understanding of the target group's relation to and experience with getting tested. This led way to a design process, where multiple rounds of brainstorming followed by evaluations of themes and concepts eventually produced two concepts to be user tested. One of the concepts performed better in the user tests, and was chosen to be finished and developed into a campaign consisting of three ads.
