Hey!

I'm Malin, as the big bold letters above might indicate, and this is, believe it or not, my portfolio.

I recently graduated from Linköping University with a Bachelor's degree
in Graphic Design and Communication, and am
now about to dive in the deep end and
get my hands dirty as a graphic designer -- to mix
metaphors that perhaps shouldn't be mixed.

My years studying graphic design have allowed me
to explore a broad range of design disciplines,
and thanks to that I can now confidently say my heart is in
coming up with creative concepts, solving design 
problems, and coding (tinkering with the code for this website is one of my favorite hobbies).
I do, however, also find great joy in developing 
graphic identities, doing layout work, and writing copy.

Hit me up using the contact form if you wanna discuss working together in any capacity!
