      <h2 class="main-heading">Fictional Brands</h2>
      <p>On this page you'll find a collection of graphic identity sheets for fictional brands.
      Since I started doing these in 2023, they've been a way for me
      to try new things, play around and explore visually. Best of all? There are no stakes.</p>

      <p>The brands are shown in chronological order with the oldest one at the top.</p>

      <h2 class="tile-heading">Frames & Frames</h2>
      <p>Frames & Frames is a small business selling glasses and picture frames, and it's unclear whether
      the name or the business idea came first. The target group is young adults, mainly those cool kids
      you'll find browsing op shops and drinking iced oat lattes. F&F wants to be perceived as
      a little bit eclectic, but also laid-back and a bit retro, and the result is a graphic profile where
      funky fonts are combined with contrasting, vintage inspired colours to create a harmonious yet colourful look.

      <h2 class="tile-heading">Creative Tub</h2>
      <p>Creative Tub is a creative agency, and rumour has it it gets its name from how the founder gets their
      best ideas in the bath tub. The target group is small and medium enterprises, and Creative Tub wishes
      for these customers to perceive them as creative (duh) and bold. This has resulted in a graphic profile
      that uses soft shapes, bold fonts and intriguing colours to create a "head in the clouds, feet on the ground" sort of vibe.

      <h2 class="tile-heading">Bernie's</h2>
      <p>Bernie's is a simple place. They sell coffee and tea and not much else. The target group consists of
        caffeine addicts and tea lovers, and the company wants to be perceived as no-fuss, passionate
        and knowledgeable. The graphic profile is thus pared back, but uses eye-catching fonts
        and popping colours as to avoid becoming bland.

      <p>Blue Gum Botanicals, or BGB, is a skincare brand from Tasmania, Australia, with a target group consisting of
      skincare addicts and minimalists. The graphic profile draws inspiration from Tasmania's nature and its
      clean, crisp air, all in a minimalist way to communicate that these products
      contain no more ingredients than necessary.</p>

      <p>Shapes & Colours is a Melbourne-based event that's described as an "immersive experience", but we're still
      not sure precisely what that entails. The target group is curious people of all ages, and below is
      marketing collateral for the event. The aim of the graphic profile is to convey Shapes & Colours
      as fun and intriguing, and ultimately to get people through the door paying for tickets.</p>

      <h2 class="tile-heading">Bodie's Books</h2>
      <p>Bodie's Books is a small bookshop in London that exudes coziness and nerdiness.
        The target group consists of booklovers looking for their next great read, 
        and locals looking for a place to sit down and relax for a moment. The graphic profile 
        draws inspiration from old libraries, dusty classics, and the nearby Hampstead Heath.
