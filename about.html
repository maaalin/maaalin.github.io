      <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet. On this website, which I did indeed build myself from scratch (thank you for
        asking, it really was quite the journey), I've gathered some of my favourite pieces of
        mine from the past few years. Have a look around or keep reading to hear more about who I am. </p>


    <p> I'm a recently graduated graphic designer who's just finding my footing in the industry.
      Having just spent a year in Australia working in printing, drinking boatloads of coffee
      and learning about footy, I'm now back in the mother country, ready to <s>kick some ass</s> further my
      career and soak up new knowledge like a sponge.</p>


<p>As a designer, the areas my heart beats a bit faster for are branding,
  editorial design, and marketing. I do, however, also enjoy mixing in some
  copywriting, UX design, and just pure nitty gritty fiddling around in the Adobe CC software. </p>


<p>I got my Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design and
  Communication from Linköping University in 2023, after
  having spent five semesters in Norrköping,
  and one semester at RMIT in Melbourne. </p>



<!-- <p>I’m currently employed within the printing industry,
  and thus spend a lot of my days helping clients express their
  brand vision through printed artefacts, fine-tuning and preparing files
  for print, and learning as much as I possibly can in this role. <p> -->

<!-- <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm a graphic designer who's just moved to Melbourne, Australia from Sweden.
  On this site, you'll find some of my work from the past few years.
  </p>

<p>Currently, the areas my heart beats a bit faster for are branding,
  web design, and editorial design. I do, however, also enjoy mixing in
  some copywriting, UX design, and just pure nitty gritty fiddling around in
  the Adobe CC software. As a designer, I almost always strive for aesthetic functionality.</p>

  <p>
I got my Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design and Communication from Linköping University earlier this year,
after having spent five semesters in beautiful Norrköping in Sweden, and one semester at RMIT here in Melbourne.

  <p>At the moment I'm open to taking on new projects, freelance or not.

  I have just graduated from Linköping University with a Bachelor's degree
in Graphic Design and Communication, and am
now about to dive in the deep end and
get my hands dirty as a graphic designer -- to mix
metaphors that perhaps shouldn't be mixed.</p>

<p>My years studying graphic design have allowed me
to explore a broad range of design disciplines,
and thanks to that I can now confidently say my heart is in
coming up with <span class="emphasis">creative concepts, solving design
problems,</span>  and <span class="emphasis">coding</span> (tinkering with the code for this website is one of my favorite hobbies).
I do, however, also find great joy in developing<span class="emphasis">
graphic identities, doing layout work,</span> and <span class="emphasis">writing copy.</span></p>

<p>Oh, and I spent my fifth semester studying abroad at RMIT University in Melbourne,
  Australia. Invaluable experience that did leave me with some solid portfolio content.</p>
