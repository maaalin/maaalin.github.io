      <h2>Hey there!</h2>

<p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm a graphic designer who's just moved to Melbourne, Australia from Sweden.
  On this site, you'll find some of my work from the past few years.
  </p>

<p>Currently, the areas my heart beats a bit faster for are branding,
  web design, and editorial design. I do, however, also enjoy mixing in
  some copywriting, UX design, and just pure nitty gritty fiddling around in
  the Adobe CC software. As a designer, I almost always strive for aesthetic functionality.</p>

  <p>
I got my Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design and Communication from Linköping University earlier this year,
after having spent five semesters in beautiful Norrköping in Sweden, and one semester at RMIT here in Melbourne.
  </p>

  <p>At the moment I'm open to taking on new projects, freelance or not. Hit me up using the <b><a href="contact.html">contact form</a> </b>or shoot me a dm at <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/postersandtea" target="_blank">@postersandtea</a> </b>if you wanna discuss working together in any capacity!</p>

  I have just graduated from Linköping University with a Bachelor's degree
in Graphic Design and Communication, and am
now about to dive in the deep end and
get my hands dirty as a graphic designer -- to mix
metaphors that perhaps shouldn't be mixed.</p>

<p>My years studying graphic design have allowed me
to explore a broad range of design disciplines,
and thanks to that I can now confidently say my heart is in
coming up with <span class="emphasis">creative concepts, solving design
problems,</span>  and <span class="emphasis">coding</span> (tinkering with the code for this website is one of my favorite hobbies).
I do, however, also find great joy in developing<span class="emphasis">
graphic identities, doing layout work,</span> and <span class="emphasis">writing copy.</span></p>

<p>Oh, and I spent my fifth semester studying abroad at RMIT University in Melbourne,
  Australia. Invaluable experience that did leave me with some solid portfolio content.</p>
