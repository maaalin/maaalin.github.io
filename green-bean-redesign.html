      <h2 class="heading-animated-left">Green Bean Redesign</h2>
      <p><span class="emphasis">What: </span>Rebranding The Green Bean Co., a fictional brand originally
      created by myself and Sofia Krantz as part of a course assignment in 2021.</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis">When: </span>2024</p>

  <p><span class="emphasis">Client: </span>The Green Bean Co., a company making and distributing vegan food products.</p>

  <p><span class="emphasis">Target group: </span>Vegans, vegetarians, and those looking to incorporate more plant-based foods into their diets,
  whether it be for ethical, environmental or health reasons, or perhaps for no reason at all.</p>

  <p><span class="emphasis">Objective: </span>The original Green Bean is a brand I look at fondly, but not something
  that represents who I am as a designer today, three and a half years after its creation.
The objective was therefore to give it a new look and a clearer identity, and turn it into something
portfolio-worthy.</p>

  <p><span class="emphasis">Challenges: </span>The original Green Bean didn't have a strong identity, and
    so the biggest challenge was to give the brand an identity and a voice, as well as
    figure out how these would transfer to visuals.
    </p>

    <p><em>
    This is an ongoing project. Stay tuned!</em>
    </p>

        <h2 class="snap-h2">Brand identity</h2>
        <p>

        I started off by figuring out Green Bean’s identity.
        Who was this character? Originally, Green Bean was kind,
        honest and reliable -- and perhaps a bit boring. New Green
        Bean was to be bold and unapologetic, straight to the point and energetic.</p>

    <p>    Based on this, I created a moodboard to get a feel for how this might look visually.
        The album brat by Charli xcx, the idea of moving forward, and lemons were all of
        great inspiration. </p>

      <div class="tile">
        <h2 class="snap-h2">Logo</h2>
        <p>The new logo uses the same idea as the old logo of
          stacking the words asymmetrically, but does so using a
          different font and creates a different shape.
          While I do like the og logo, it was hard to work with and for that
          reason I ended up making it a lot more compact. I also switched out the old,
           agreeable font for a more modern looking one that has more open letters and
           comes in more weights.</p>

      <div class="tile">
        <h2 class="snap-h2">Colours and fonts</h2>
        <p>The original colours, while pretty, were subdued and
          lacked energy. I decided to cut down on the amount and zero in on green,
          because any other colour paired with the brand name would look stupid. I
          ended up picking a loud lime-ish green and a darker forest green as the primary colours.
          The lime green is the bold and unapologetic one out of the two, and the forest
          green is the anchor keeping the lime green from completely going off the rails.
          I thought about bringing in a softer lemon yellow as well, but found that it a)
          made the brand feel less obnoxious and more people pleasing and b) that there really was no use for it. </p>

          <p>As for
          the fonts, Green Bean originally had four of them,
           which was too many and gave it a scattered image.
           I decided to instead go with two: one a bit bolder, and one a bit more plain.

      <div class="tile">
        <h2 class="snap-h2">Packaging</h2>
        <p>Time to bring all the elements together! The original packaging was fairly
        aesthethically pleasing, but felt rather quiet and almost a bit shy.
      The goal was therefore for the new designs to be loud and perhaps even a bit
    obnoxious. I designed three proposals based on the brand elements, and eventually
  combined two of them to create the template for all of Green Bean's packaging. The white
areas on the designs are where the plastic goes, so that customers can see what they're buying.</p>

      <div class="tile">
        <h2 class="snap-h2">Advertising</h2>
        <p>The original Green Bean ads were descriptive, but lacked personality.
          This time around, I wanted the ads to be more eye-catching, more thought provoking,
          and less expected. Based on the brand identity, I came up with the idea to
          let the early stage advertising focus on beating the critics to it, so to speak. Another vegan brand? Ugh,
          we know it's annoying. Vegan cheese? Let's be real, it's probably not gonna melt that well.
          Oh you hate vegan food? Eh, we don't blame you.</p>

          <p>
            The idea is for these ads to stand out, to get the attention of the consumers,
            and to thereby create brand awareness and, hopefully, curiosity. The ads are simple, minimalist,
            pared down, almost to the point of being obnoxious. Who <em>are</em> these people thinking
            they can advertise food products without even showing the food products? Probably morons, truth be told.
            But vegan cheese really isn't that sexy.
