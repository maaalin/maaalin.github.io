      <p><span class="emphasis">When: </span>2023-2024</p>

  <p><span class="emphasis">Client: </span>Snap Printing Werribee, a printing franchise in Melbourne, Australia</p>

  <p><span class="emphasis">Target group: </span>Customers and potential customers of Snap, both individuals and businesses</p>

  <p><span class="emphasis">Objective: </span>To develop marketing material based on the company's graphic profile. This
  included creating social media posts for public holidays, designing promotional stickers to show off
different printing techniques, and creating a window decal to decorate the office for the holidays</p>

  <p><span class="emphasis">Challenges: </span>Adhering to the graphic profile while still keeping
    the designs varied and interesting.
    </p>

    <p><em>
    The internal work I did at Snap comprised only a small part of my duties there,
    but it was where I could take my time and really play around with different expressions.</em>

    <div class="tile">
      <h2 class="snap-h2">Box labels</h2>
      <p>I was asked to design a sticker we could put on the boxes customers would get their orders in, that would
      encourage said customers to return the boxes to us rather than just throw them away. The results of my first draft
    (second image below) were some straight to the point stickers, functional but perhaps neither encouraging
  nor eye-catching. Back to the drawing board I went, this time thinking about ways to make the design more inviting,
friendlier, more fun... I struggled here with coming up with ideas or even finding inspiration, and so what I did
was to stop trying to be so logical about it and just go with what popped into my head. Thus, I ended up with a rainbow,
a yard sign, a big blob -- things that might not typically be associated with sustainability and the environment,
but indeed things that are both friendly and inviting.  </p>

  <h2 class="snap-h2">Promo stickers</h2>
  <p>Displayed below are some promotional stickers that were designed to show off various print finishes.
    Perhaps my favorite internal project while at Snap, as I had a lot of freedom in coming up with designs.
    They're all based on the graphic profile, but I also brought in a script font (can also be seen in the mother's
    day post above and the gingerbread house design below) and reused a few elements from previous poster designs
    of mine. I haven't included the intended finishes on this page, just wanted to show of the designs.

      <h2 class="snap-h2">Gingerbread houses</h2>
      <p>A few weeks before the holidays, I was asked to design a massive decal we could put
        on the window dividing the office and the shop at Snap. "Oh shit," I thought, "how am I ever going to manage this?"
        My first few sketches of gingerbread houses were pretty shit if I may say so myself,
        but once I actively started seeking out inspiration the design started taking shape.
        I ended up creating three houses and placing them in a snowy landscape, with snowflakes and the text "Happy Holidays!"
        above. The biggest challenge was to create something that would integrate nicely in the shop, while it, of course,
        also had to be Snap-branded. The yellow on the candy canes is Snap yellow, and the digital
        version of this design has a Snap blue sky. Who said you need red to get that Christmas feeling?
