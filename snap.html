        <p>Some of the things I did while working at Snap Printing in Melbourne, Australia (2023-2024). The box labels
          and gingerbread decals were designed for Snap itself and are based on the company's graphic profile,
          while the items at the bottom of this page were designed for various customers, some with an established
          graphic identity, some with nothing more than a business name.

        <h2 class="tile-heading">Box labels</h2>
        <p class="tile-text">These were designed to be put on the boxes customers would get their orders in,
          and the purpose of them was to encourage said customers to return the boxes to us rather than just throw them
          away.
          The first iteration resulted in some functional but kind of boring stickers, so I went
          back to the drawing board and tried to think of a way to communicate in a more engaging way about cardboard
          boxes.
          Drawing nothing but blanks, I eventually gave up on trying to solve the problem using logic, and instead
          started just
          drawing whatever popped into my head. And that, dear reader, is how I ended up with a rainbow,
          a yard sign, a big blob – things that might not typically be associated with sustainability and the
          environment,
          but indeed things that are both friendly and inviting. </p>

        <h2 class="tile-heading">Gingerbread houses</h2>
        <p class="tile-text">A few weeks before the holidays, I was asked to design a massive decal we could put
          on the window dividing the office and the shop at Snap. The requirements were for it to be festive
          and to adhere to the graphic profile.
          I ended up designing three gingerbread houses and placing them in a snowy landscape, with snowflakes and the
          text "Happy Holidays!"
          above. The yellow on the candy canes is Snap yellow, the brown on the houses is inspired by
          the cardboard boxes we'd deliver orders in, and the digital
          version of this design has a Snap blue sky.
