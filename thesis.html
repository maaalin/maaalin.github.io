      <p>Design-oriented bachelor's thesis (2023) exploring how visual communication
        can be used in order to encourage sexually active young adults to get tested for
        STD's. </p>

      <p>  One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to communicate about a
        sensitive and somewhat stigmatized topic in an appealing way. I based my design
        work off of a frame of reference that dived into sexual health and risk-taking,
        health communication, cultural aspects and behavioural design, and combined this
        with a preliminary study that sought to gain an understanding of the target group's
        relation to and experience with getting tested. This led way to a design process,
        where multiple rounds of brainstorming followed by evaluations of themes and concepts
        eventually produced two concepts to be user tested. One of the concepts performed better
        in the user tests, and was chosen to be finished and developed into a campaign consisting
        of three ads. </p>

Get tested with every new partner to catch and treat them early on. Order a home test today via klamydia.se, or

        <p>The chosen channels for the campaign were outdoor advertising for its widespread exposure;
          printed media for its relatively high perceived level of trustworthiness; and social media
          for its possibility of interpersonal communication. For sources, please refer to the paper,

        <p>The conceptual phase of the project focused on coming up with
          a concept that talked about STDs and getting tested, without invoking a sense
          of shame or guilt in those who participate in especially casual sex. Below are scamps from
          two sessions spent brainstorming and exploring this topic.

        <p>Below are three versions each of the concepts the conceptual phase resulted in.
        Designs 1.3 and 2.1 were eventually user tested, with the latter one performing significantly
        better than the sooner. After this phase, I refined the design slightly as well as added a
        QR code (an idea that was proposed by one of the users) for the printed ads.</p>
